All sound effects are empty wav files on purpose.

Due to project's age and neglect, the source of copyrights and authors have been lost; therefore, uploading the materials isn't a good idea. Additionally when sourcing new sound files, the audio levels were off and not to my liking.

On the other hand, the file names are descriptive to the effects they correspond to. If you're ambitious for whatever reason, you can find some sound effects, drop them into the folder, and the sounds will work in the game.
