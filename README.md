# Space Ranger
Lone space ship surrounded by enemy ships. Destroy hostile ships before they do the same to you. Win condition is surviving with no more hostile ships pursuing yours.

# Origin
This project was made in the Spring of 2012 for a Game Programming course at university. Written entirely in Lua using Love2D.

# License
All source code, unless stated in a header, is subject to MIT License.

# Setup
Currently this only runs using Love 8.0 ( https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/ )

Using newer versions of Love will likely give a litany of runtime errors.

# Playing
Controls use WASD and Space Bar. Keys are mappable.
